      <description>Scenario: You need to register a Windows Virtual machines as a deployment target in Azure DevOps Project. Also, the VMs are placed in a secure zone where files cannot be downloaded directly due to firewall restrictions. Hence, you cannot use the ADO default registration script to download the vsts agent and register it.
Steps to configure it -
Azure DevOps - Create a new Deployment Group eg. DG-External This is where the VMs will be registered.</description>

      <description>Although, I dont work much on AAD or IDAM side, there are times when I quickly need to refer to some details in Office365. Mainly due to someone is after this info, side effects of having GOD mode access&amp;hellip;.
End result I would like to run Get-MsolAccountSku i. Install MSOnline module on Windows Powershell, Install-Module MSOnline
ii. Connecto MSolService Connect-MsolService this would prompt for username and password. So if you work in Azure PIM environment, elevate your access first before running this cmdlet.</description>

      <title>Github, Azure Repos and SSH Authentication</title>

      <description>I often need to setup ssh authentication to access repos (github/azure repos). This is a quick post to keep all that information handy.
On your local machine (using bash prompt), run the below command to generate key. You can add a passphrase which improves or adds another layer of security. ssh-keygen -C &amp;quot;youremail@email.com&amp;quot;
This should generate two files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. Remember to keep id_rsa safe and dont accidentially copy this in source code or any publicly accessible endpoint.</description>
